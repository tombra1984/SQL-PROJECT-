# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Provide information on the relationship between products, visitors of the site and sales

## Process
### (your step 1)
Load the data, clean and run quality assurance on data
### (your step 2)
Analize the data with queries to specific questions to generate answers 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
- The data showed the product that generated the most and least revenue amoung all the products being sold

-Understanding the header names of the columns and what they represented was challenging during creating the tables associated with the dataset i.e data type.
-identifying how the tables were related was a major challenge.

## Future Goals
(cwhat would you do if you had more time?)
create my own tables that expanded on the data uniqueness and explored better relationships with the dataset.
